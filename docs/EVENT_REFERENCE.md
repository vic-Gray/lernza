# Event Reference

Every event emitted by Lernza's Soroban contracts. Indexers and off-chain listeners can subscribe to these topics via the Stellar RPC `getEvents` endpoint.

## How Soroban Events Work

Each event has:
- **Topics** — a tuple of `Symbol` values used for filtering (the first element is always the event name).
- **Data** — a tuple of values carrying the event payload.

Filter by topic using the Stellar RPC:

```bash
stellar contract events \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --start-ledger <LEDGER>
```

### `certificate_minted` (from milestone contract)

| **Topics** | `(Symbol("certificate_minted"),)` | |
| `quest_id` | `u32` | Quest that was fully completed. |
| `enrollee` | `Address` | Learner who received the certificate. |

**Data tuple:** `(quest_id, enrollee)`

## Rewards Contract (`contracts/rewards/`)

> **Indexer migration note (workspace → quest).** Earlier deployments of the rewards contract (pre-PR #412 / commit `1bcc507`) used `workspace_*` naming for the public surface. The current contract emits **only the `reward_funded` / `reward_distributed` / `reward_refunded` events documented below — `workspace_*` event symbols never existed in any released build.** Indexers should:
>
> - Filter on `Symbol("reward_funded" | "reward_distributed" | "reward_refunded")`. No backwards-compatible aliases are emitted; nothing to migrate at the event topic layer.
> - Update any function-call references the indexer reads from operation envelopes: `fund_workspace` → `fund_quest`, parameter `workspace_id` → `quest_id`.
> - Update storage-key probes if the indexer reads `DataKey` ledger entries directly: `WorkspaceAuthority(u32)` → `QuestAuthority(u32)`, `WorkspacePool(u32)` → `QuestPool(u32)`.
>
> Old testnet deployments still on the pre-rename WASM should be redeployed; the on-chain interface is incompatible.
